# RuneBook Redux

"Come. The runes beckon." --[Ryze](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ryze)

RuneBook is my favorite League of Legends add-on. It's elegant in its simplicity, and does its job of managing rune pages in League of Legends very well.

In May of 2020 [RuneBook](https://github.com/OrangeNote/RuneBook) stopped working for me on the Mac. I looked through each existing fork, and though some of them were updated recently, none of them appeared to include active Mac development. I did a bit of digging into the code, and I figured I might as well be the one to get it going again.
